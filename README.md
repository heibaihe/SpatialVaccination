# SpatialVaccination

Simulation codes accompanying the paper entiled "A spatial vaccination strategy to reduce the risk of vaccine-resistant variants" published in XXXXX were written C.

All codes are listed as follows: 

P_vs_mu: Producing Fig. 4; curves for spatial vaccination without any complementary measures in Fig.6.  
             
P_vs_K: Producing Fig. 5.

P_vs_mu_Travel_Limitations: Producing curves for spatial vaccination with limitations on travel between vaccinated and unvaccinated regions in Fig.6.  

P_vs_mu_Contact_Tracing: Producing curves for spatial vaccination with contact tracing of the resistant variant in Fig.6.

P_vs_mu_Moving_Lockdown: Producing curves for spatial vaccination with a moving temporary lockdown in Fig.6.

P_vs_mu&d_15%Uniform: Producing the curves for spatial vaccination with vaccinating the vulnerable population first in Fig.7.

P_vs_unvaccinated: Producing Fig. 8a.

P_vs_leak: Producing Fig. 8b.

P_vs_wanning: Producing Fig. 8c.

P_vs_mu&d: Producing the heatmaps in Fig.7 a and b.

P_vs_mu&d_InfectR: Producing the heatmaps in Fig.7 c and d, with that the variant can infect individuals who have recovered from infection with the wild type. 

P_vs_mu&e: Producing the heatmaps in Fig.7 e and f.

3Dimensional_mu_vs_d&e: Producing Fig. 10.

P_vs_mu_heterogeneous: Producing Fig. 11.

Notes:
As a rule, variable names are identical in the paper and the code. Variables not
appearing in the paper are documneted in comment in their first instance.
